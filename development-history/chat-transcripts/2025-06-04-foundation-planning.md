### 2. Membership Tier Structure
- **Basic (Free)**: 5 core assessment areas, basic FIE tracking
- **Professional ($19/mo)**: 12 assessment areas, advanced behavioral tools, team management
- **Enterprise ($39/mo)**: 18+ assessment areas, multi-school support, advanced analytics
- **Implementation**: Feature gating from day one, tier simulation before payments

### 3. Database Architecture
- **Multi-tenant ready**: User isolation built-in
- **Professional template integration**: Based on actual ConnectEd360-Docs templates
- **Compliance focus**: FERPA/HIPAA considerations in schema design
- **Texas-specific**: 45-day compliance tracking, TELPAS integration

### 4. Assessment Areas Implementation
- **Based on**: Evaluation Planning Chart from ConnectEd360-Docs
- **Structure**: 18+ assessment areas mapped to professional standards
- **Tier mapping**: Basic (5), Professional (12), Enterprise (18+)
- **Template integration**: BASC-3, WISC-V, ADOS writeups included

### 5. FIE Documentation System
- **24 sections**: Based on professional FIE completion checklist

- **Texas compliance**: 45-day timeline tracking
- **Assessment standards**: NASP ethical guidelines
- **Legal defensibility**: Professional template language

## Next Session Action Items
- [ ] Set up development environment - Owner - Next week
- [ ] Create initial Next.js project structure - Owner - Next week  
- [ ] Configure PostgreSQL database - Owner - Next week
- [ ] Implement basic authentication - Next session - Next week
- [ ] Build student management foundation - Next session - Week 2

## Questions Resolved
1. ✅ **Existing code**: None exists, building from scratch
2. ✅ **HIPAA/FERPA compliance**: Vercel Pro supports this
3. ✅ **Learning curve**: Vercel is beginner-friendly
4. ✅ **Timeline**: Fall 2025 realistic for paying customers
5. ✅ **Documentation strategy**: Chat transcripts + structured docs

## Strategic Insights

### Market Opportunity:
- **Large addressable market**: 10K+ school psychologists in Texas alone
- **Professional need**: Current tools inadequate for FIE compliance
- **Conference circuit**: Direct access to target audience
- **Network effects**: Professional referrals drive growth

### Competitive Advantages:
- **Professional templates**: Based on actual practitioner workflows
- **Compliance focus**: Texas 45-day requirements built-in
- **Scalable pricing**: Grows with user needs
- **Conference presence**: Direct relationship building

### Risk Mitigation:
- **Start small**: Basic tier validates concept
- **Professional input**: Based on real practitioner needs  
- **Compliance first**: HIPAA/FERPA from day one
- **Documentation**: Complete development history preserved

## Next Session Focus
1. **Environment setup**: Get development environment running
2. **Authentication**: Implement user registration/login
3. **Basic UI**: Student table with add/edit functionality
4. **Tier simulation**: Implement feature gating without payments
